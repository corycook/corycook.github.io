    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome! If you found your way to my little corner of the internet then please 
        <a href="mailto:clovecooks@gmail.com">let me know</a>. I am a Computer Scientist. 
        I graduated from Cal State, San Bernardino then from SJSU. My dream was to work for Intel and, thanks to (tons of)
        support from my lovely wife, I was able to achieve that dream. I have been developing software professionally since
        2012, but I would like to do research someday. I am interested in areas of Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language
        Processing, Grammatical Inference, and Graphics and Parallel Processing.
